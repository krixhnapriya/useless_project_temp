### Project Description
How Dead Inside Are You During Class? is a fun and interactive web application that uses face recognition and emotion detection to measure how ‚Äúdead inside‚Äù you look during class. Instead of giving boring emotion labels, the app humorously transforms your facial expression into a boredom level meter and pairs it with witty roast messages to keep things entertaining.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Students worldwide suffer from a severe condition called ‚ÄúDead Inside During Class Syndrome‚Äù.
Symptoms include: blank stares, suppressed yawns, and the sudden ability to contemplate the meaning of life instead of paying attention.
Until now, no one had the courage to measure just how dead inside you look.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Dead Inside Detector ‚Äì a cutting-edge, totally unnecessary web app that scans your face and gives you a Boredom Level Score with maximum roasting energy.
Instead of boring data, you get:

A speedometer of doom showing your ‚Äúhow-dead-inside-you-are‚Äù percentage.

Savage roast lines that hit harder than your teacher‚Äôs disappointment.

Funny sound effects and random memes to match your lifeless expression.
